# minChat - Instant Messaging

## Class

This project was created for my CS494 Internetworking Protocols class. 
The project invloved writing a RFC document, designing the Application Layer protocol, and then implementing a server and client based on the design. 

## Features
* Very simple IRC-like protocol
* Basic CLI client
* Server handles many clients at once
* Multi-channel support
* Client saves window state inbetween channel switches
